# 🔐 Message Encryption and Decryption (Python)

This project implements a simple encryption and decryption tool using Python. It also simulates basic QA processes including test case design, bug tracking, and validation of inputs and outputs.

---

## 📌 Features

- Encrypts plain text using Caesar Cipher and XOR-based logic.
- Decrypts encoded messages back to original.
- File input/output support for storing and loading encrypted data.
- Logs encrypted messages into a local SQLite database (optional).
- Includes manual test case simulation and mock bug tracking (Jira-style).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Tools**: Notepad++, Command Line, SQLite (optional)
- **QA Tools**: Manual test cases, Mock Jira board (Excel/Google Sheets)

## ✅ Functionalities

| Function        | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Encrypt Text    | Takes input and applies Caesar Cipher      |
| Decrypt Text    | Reverses the encryption                    |
| Save to File    | Stores the output in a `.txt` file         |
| Read from File  | Reads and decrypts content from file       |
| Log to DB       | (Optional) Stores data in SQLite           |

## 🧪 QA Process (Manual Testing)

- **Functional Testing** for encryption/decryption logic
- **Boundary Testing** with long and special character inputs
- **Negative Testing** for empty strings, invalid keys
- **Bug Reporting** simulated via mock Jira board
